This repo automates the setup and management of toy datasets. This is intended 
to be used as for developing and testing scripts and pipelines.

The directory is structured, as follows

- scripts/: scripts to download and process datasets
- resources/: contains input files required to run the scripts
- Makefile: executes the targets

To use this repo, run

# Run all targets
make

# Run specific target
make vcf

To create a new dataset, create a new script in the scripts/ directory and add a
target to the Makefile. After executing the target, update the README to list
the newely created dataset

The scripts expect a default directory to be set for the cache TOY_DATASET 
otherwise a toy-datasets/ directory will be created current working directory.
